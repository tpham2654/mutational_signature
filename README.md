# mutational-signature
Library for computing mutational-signatures enrichment (like APOBEC signature) in a genome :alien:

# Usage
(Awesome & easy-to-follow documentation is coming - very soon)

## Input
* Mutations: VCF or MAF
* Reference genome: FASTA or FA

## Output
* Results (n_features-x-n_samples): TXT (tab-separated)
* Ranking & distribution of the enrichment): PDF
